    "The following functions help to construct and solve a linear optimization problem using nutrition data. We assume the data is in the form of a dataframe where each row represents a food item, and columns represent macronutrients, micronutrients, and other facts. The constraint matrix will be built in the same format, meaning that the actual constraints are the *columns,* not the *rows,* of the constraint matrix. In other words, the matrix we build is actually the transpose of the matrix we want."

    "Takes a dataframe whose rows represent food items, and having columns named `pct_*` that represent percentages of the Recommended Dietary Intake (RDI) of one or more nutrients, and returns two things: a dataframe of linear constraints, and an array of upper bounds for each. Assuming that your objective involves meeting the RDI, these can be used as the basis of a linear optimization by adding more constraints or by defining the desired objective function."
